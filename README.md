# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a student project from [TheOdinProject](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-programming/oop) designed to demonstrate introductory concepts behind object oriented programming.  This mostly entails writting and organizing classes, as well as being able to call class instances throughout the program.

Later, this projected was revisited to explore the concepts behind RSpec and Test Driven Development.  Specs were written for critical game functions such as chceking for winners, and making sure that the board state is correctly represented after user input.

##Features

+ Plays against another human player or against CPU
+ Simple AI allows CPU to make random legal move
+ Allows players to enter their names
+ Allows players to choose their mark (whether to play as X or O)
+ Declares a winner along with name and mark after making a winning move
+ Declares draws after last move that fills board

##ToDo

+ Refactor code to further modularize code
+ Avoid methods that do more than one thing
+ Create a cleaner game loop
+ Allow for networking so two players can play against each other from different computers
+ Develop A.I. that wins 100% of the time
